    projectTitle: "Hover Racing",
    projectDescription:
      "Through my work on Hover Racing, I gained valuable experience in Unity game development. This project allowed me to deeply immerse myself in the Unity framework while designing and implementing a sophisticated hover car physics system for player vehicles. Additionally, I tackled the challenge of creating a fundamental dedicated multiplayer server in .NET, with a focus on seamlessly synchronizing player movement across various devices. This hands-on experience not only honed my skills in game physics but also strengthened my ability to devise effective network solutions.",
